# Internationalization Commit Guideline

**Scope**: All tasks involving language translation or `i18n`.

1. **Target Branch**  
   • All i18n changes **must** be committed to `feature/multi-language`.  
   • Do **not** commit i18n work directly to `main`.

2. **Pre-Commit Approval Workflow**  
   • Before staging/committing, the AI assistant must:  
     1. Clearly state the branch it will commit to.  
     2. Obtain explicit user approval.  
   • Only after approval may `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` be executed.

3. **Safety Check**  
   • If the current branch is not `feature/multi-language`, abort the commit and prompt the user.
