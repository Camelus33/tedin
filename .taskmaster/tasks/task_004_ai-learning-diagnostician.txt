# Description: Set up the basic three-column layout structure for the Knowledge Blueprint page, ensuring responsiveness for desktop and mobile views.
# Details:
1.  Create a new component `KnowledgeBlueprintPage`.
2.  Implement a three-column layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox.  Consider using a library like Material UI Grid or similar for responsiveness.
3.  Define CSS media queries to switch to a single-column layout on mobile devices (screen width < 768px).

2.  Verify the single-column layout on mobile devices and small screen sizes.
3.  Ensure smooth transition between layouts on different screen sizes.
