# Title: Implement Visual Language for Graph Relationships
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the visual styling for the vector graph relationships (cause-effect, before-after, etc.) according to the 'Visual Language' proposal.
# Details:
1.  Define distinct visual styles (line styles, icons, colors) for each type of relationship (cause-effect, before-after, etc.).
2.  Modify the graph rendering logic to apply these styles based on the relationship type.
3.  Ensure that the visual styles are clear and easily distinguishable.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that each type of relationship is rendered with its corresponding visual style.
2.  Ensure that the visual styles are consistent and easy to understand.
3.  Test with different graph configurations to ensure that the styles are applied correctly in all cases.
