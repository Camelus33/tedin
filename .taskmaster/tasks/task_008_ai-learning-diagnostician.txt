# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Inspector Panel for Memo Card Details
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Inspector Panel to display the full details of the currently selected memo card (node).
# Details:
1.  Create an `InspectorPanel` component within the `KnowledgeBlueprintPage`.
2.  Implement a mechanism to track the currently selected node in the Canvas.
3.  When a node is selected, fetch its details and display them in the `InspectorPanel`.
4.  Ensure that all original content from the existing shared page (notes, user markdown, metadata) is displayed correctly in the `InspectorPanel`.
5.  Use a markdown rendering library like react-markdown to display user markdown.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the Inspector Panel displays the correct details for the selected node.
2.  Verify that all original content is displayed correctly, including notes, user markdown, and metadata.
3.  Test with different types of nodes to ensure that the Inspector Panel works correctly in all cases.
