# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement MongoDB Atlas Vector Search with OpenAI Embeddings
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to enable semantic search capabilities using OpenAI Embeddings API.
# Details:
1. **Set up MongoDB Atlas Cluster:** Ensure an Atlas cluster is provisioned. Choose a suitable tier based on anticipated data volume and query load. Enable Atlas Search during cluster creation.
2. **Create a Vector Search Index:** Define a new Atlas Search index with the `vectorType` set to 'denseVector'. Configure the `fields` array to include the field containing the OpenAI embeddings. Specify the `dimensions` to match the embedding vector size (e.g., 1536 for `text-embedding-ada-002`).
3. **Generate OpenAI Embeddings:** Use the OpenAI Embeddings API (`text-embedding-ada-002` model is recommended for cost-effectiveness and performance) to generate vector embeddings for the text data to be indexed.  Handle API rate limits gracefully using exponential backoff.
4. **Store Embeddings in MongoDB:** Store the generated embeddings in the designated MongoDB collection. Ensure the embedding vectors are stored as arrays of floating-point numbers.
5. **Implement Semantic Search Query:** Construct an aggregation pipeline that uses the `$vectorSearch` operator to perform semantic similarity search.  Specify the `index` name, `path` to the embedding field, `queryVector` (embedding of the search query generated using OpenAI), `numCandidates` (number of documents to consider), and `limit` (number of results to return).
6. **Optimize for Performance:** Monitor query performance and adjust the `numCandidates` parameter to balance recall and latency. Consider using pre-filtering techniques to reduce the search space.
7. **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling to catch potential issues with the OpenAI API, Atlas Search, and data processing. Log relevant information for debugging and monitoring.
8. **Security Considerations:** Secure the OpenAI API key and MongoDB Atlas credentials using environment variables or a secrets management system. Implement appropriate access control measures to protect sensitive data.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Index Creation Verification:** Verify that the Atlas Search index is created successfully with the correct configuration (vector type, dimensions, fields).
2. **Embedding Generation and Storage:** Confirm that OpenAI embeddings are generated correctly and stored in MongoDB as arrays of floating-point numbers.
3. **Semantic Search Accuracy:** Test the semantic search functionality with a variety of queries. Evaluate the relevance of the search results based on semantic similarity, not just keyword matching. Use a ground truth dataset to measure precision and recall.
4. **Performance Testing:** Measure the query latency for different query types and data volumes. Ensure that the performance meets the required SLAs.  Test with concurrent users to assess scalability.
5. **Error Handling Validation:** Simulate error conditions (e.g., OpenAI API errors, invalid data) and verify that the application handles them gracefully and logs appropriate error messages.
6. **Security Audit:** Review the code and configuration to ensure that API keys and database credentials are not exposed and that access control is properly implemented.
