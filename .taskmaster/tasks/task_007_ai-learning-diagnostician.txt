# Title: Implement Map Panel with Minimap and Navigation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Map Panel to display a minimap of the entire vector graph and provide search/navigation functionality.
# Details:
1.  Create a `MapPanel` component within the `KnowledgeBlueprintPage`.
2.  Render a smaller version of the vector graph within the `MapPanel`, showing the entire graph at a glance.
3.  Implement search functionality to allow users to search for specific nodes.
4.  Implement navigation functionality to allow users to jump to specific nodes in the Canvas by clicking on them in the Map Panel.
5.  Consider using a library like react-select for the search functionality.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the minimap is rendered correctly in the Map Panel.
2.  Verify that the search functionality works correctly.
3.  Verify that navigation from the Map Panel to the Canvas works correctly.
4.  Ensure that the Map Panel is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
