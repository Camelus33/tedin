# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate Vector Graph Rendering into Canvas
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the vector graph rendering logic from the existing summary note edit page into the Canvas component of the Knowledge Blueprint.
# Details:
1.  Reuse the existing code from `summary-notes/[summaryNoteId]/edit/page.tsx` responsible for rendering the vector graph (`diagram` data).
2.  Create a `Canvas` component within the `KnowledgeBlueprintPage`.
3.  Pass the `diagram` data to the `Canvas` component.
4.  Adapt the existing graph rendering logic to fit within the `Canvas` component, ensuring proper scaling and positioning.
5.  Implement basic panning and zooming functionality using a library like react-zoom-pan-pinch.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the vector graph is rendered correctly within the Canvas.
2.  Verify that all nodes and relationships are visible.
3.  Test panning and zooming functionality.
4.  Compare the rendered graph with the original summary note edit page to ensure visual consistency.
