# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Dependency Installation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the React/Next.js project environment with Tailwind CSS, ensuring compatibility with existing TSNoteCard component and react-pdf library.
# Details:
1.  Verify Node.js and npm are installed (>=18.x and >=8.x respectively).
2.  Initialize a new Next.js project or navigate to the existing project directory.
3.  Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
4.  Configure Tailwind CSS by running `npx tailwindcss init -p` and updating `tailwind.config.js` with necessary configurations.
5.  Install `react-pdf` library: `npm install react-pdf`
6.  Verify that the TSNoteCard component is correctly set up and styled.
7.  Address any compatibility issues between Tailwind CSS and existing styles.
8.  Create necessary folders and files for components and utilities.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Run the development server (`npm run dev`) and ensure the application compiles without errors.
2.  Verify that Tailwind CSS styles are applied correctly.
3.  Check that the TSNoteCard component renders as expected.
4.  Ensure `react-pdf` is installed correctly and can be imported.
