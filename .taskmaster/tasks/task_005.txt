# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement AI Response Parsing and Graph Update
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the ResponseHandler to parse structured output from AI models, extract new triples representing semantic relationships, and write these triples back to the Fuseki graph database, effectively closing the learning loop.
# Details:
1.  **AI Response Parsing:** Modify the ResponseHandler to accept and parse structured output from AI models (e.g., JSON, XML, or a custom format). Implement a parsing module that can handle different output formats and extract relevant information.
2.  **Triple Extraction:** Develop a module within the ResponseHandler to extract RDF triples (subject, predicate, object) from the parsed AI response. This module should identify key entities and relationships within the response and convert them into a standardized triple format adhering to the Habitus33 ontology.
3.  **Fuseki Integration:** Integrate the triple extraction module with the Fuseki graph database. Implement functionality to write the extracted triples to the Fuseki store using SPARQL update queries. Ensure proper error handling and transaction management to maintain data consistency.
4.  **Learning Loop Closure:** Implement a mechanism to track the origin of the new triples (i.e., the AI model that generated them). This could involve adding provenance information to the triples or maintaining a separate log of AI-generated knowledge. This allows for future analysis and refinement of the AI models.
5.  **Contextual Enrichment:** Before writing triples to Fuseki, enrich the extracted triples with contextual information from the existing knowledge graph. This involves querying Fuseki to find related concepts and adding additional triples to provide context for the new knowledge.

Here's a detailed research response covering best practices for AI response parsing and RDF triple extraction from LLM outputs, along with modern approaches for structured data extraction and writing to knowledge graphs like Apache Jena Fuseki. This response is tailored to the context of your project, particularly Task 5 ("Implement AI Response Parsing and Graph Update"), Task 4 ("Implement Knowledge Gap and Hidden Link Detection Algorithms"), and related tasks.

### I. Introduction: The Importance of Structured Data Extraction

The ability to extract structured data from LLM outputs is crucial for several reasons, especially in the context of your project:

*   **Knowledge Graph Enrichment:**  LLMs can generate new knowledge or infer relationships that are not explicitly present in your existing knowledge graph. Extracting this information and adding it to Fuseki enhances the graph's completeness and usefulness.
*   **Automated Reasoning:** Structured data enables automated reasoning and inference.  By representing LLM outputs as RDF triples, you can leverage SPARQL queries to discover new connections and insights.  This directly supports Task 4, where you're aiming to detect knowledge gaps and hidden links.
*   **Closing the Learning Loop:**  As described in Task 5, parsing AI responses and updating the graph creates a feedback loop. The LLM learns from the existing knowledge graph, and its outputs, in turn, enrich the graph.
*   **Improved Accuracy:**  Structured data extraction reduces ambiguity and ensures data consistency, leading to more accurate and reliable results.

### II. Best Practices for AI Response Parsing

The first step is to ensure the LLM provides output in a predictable and parsable format. Here's a breakdown of best practices:

#### A. Controlled Output Formats

*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**  JSON is a widely supported and human-readable format. It's ideal for representing complex data structures with nested objects and arrays.  It's generally preferred over XML due to its simplicity.
    *   **Example Prompt Engineering:**  "Return the answer as a JSON object with the following keys: 'subject', 'predicate', 'object'."
    *   **Parsing Libraries:**  Use libraries like `json` in Python or `org.json` in Java for parsing JSON responses.
    *   **Schema Validation:**  Consider using JSON Schema to validate the LLM's output against a predefined schema. This helps ensure data quality and consistency.  Libraries like `jsonschema` in Python can be used for this purpose.
*   **XML (Extensible Markup Language):**  While more verbose than JSON, XML is suitable for representing hierarchical data.
    *   **Example Prompt Engineering:** "Return the answer as an XML document with the root element 'triple' and child elements 'subject', 'predicate', and 'object'."
    *   **Parsing Libraries:**  Use libraries like `xml.etree.ElementTree` in Python or `javax.xml.parsers` in Java for parsing XML responses.
    *   **XPath:**  Use XPath expressions to navigate and extract data from the XML document.
*   **CSV (Comma-Separated Values):**  CSV is a simple format for tabular data. It's suitable when the LLM needs to return a list of triples or facts.
    *   **Example Prompt Engineering:** "Return the answer as a CSV file with the columns 'subject', 'predicate', and 'object'."
    *   **Parsing Libraries:**  Use libraries like `csv` in Python or `org.apache.commons.csv` in Java for parsing CSV files.
*   **Custom Formats:**  If none of the standard formats are suitable, you can define your own custom format. However, this requires more effort to implement the parsing logic.  Ensure the format is well-defined and easy to parse.

#### B. Prompt Engineering for Structured Output

*   **Explicit Instructions:**  Clearly instruct the LLM to return the output in the desired format.  Be specific about the structure and the expected data types.
*   **Example Output:**  Provide an example of the desired output format in the prompt. This helps the LLM understand your expectations.
*   **Few-Shot Learning:**  Include a few examples of input-output pairs in the prompt. This can significantly improve the LLM's ability to generate structured output.
*   **Constraints:**  Specify any constraints on the values of the output fields. For example, you can specify the allowed values for the 'predicate' field.
*   **Temperature:**  Adjust the LLM's temperature parameter to control the randomness of the output. Lower temperatures generally lead to more consistent and predictable output.  However, a very low temperature might make the LLM too rigid and unable to handle unexpected inputs.

#### C. Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

*   **Robust Parsing:**  Implement robust parsing logic that can handle unexpected variations in the LLM's output.  Use try-except blocks to catch parsing errors and implement fallback mechanisms.
*   **Validation:**  Validate the parsed data to ensure it meets your requirements.  Check for missing fields, invalid data types, and out-of-range values.
*   **Logging:**  Log any parsing errors or validation failures. This helps you identify and fix issues with the LLM's output or your parsing logic.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:**  In cases where the parsing fails or the validation fails, consider involving a human to review the LLM's output and manually extract the data.  This is especially important for critical data.

#### D. Example Implementation (Python)

```python
import json
import re

def parse_llm_response(response_text, expected_format="json"):
    """
    Parses the LLM response based on the expected format.

    Args:
        response_text (str): The raw text response from the LLM.
        expected_format (str): The expected format of the response (e.g., "json", "triple").

    Returns:
        dict or list: A dictionary representing the parsed JSON, or a list of triples.
        Returns None if parsing fails.
    """
    try:
        if expected_format == "json":
            return json.loads(response_text)
        elif expected_format == "triple":
            # Example: "Subject: John, Predicate: knows, Object: Jane"
            match = re.match(r"Subject: (.*), Predicate: (.*), Object: (.*)", response_text)
            if match:
                return {"subject": match.group(1).strip(),
                        "predicate": match.group(2).strip(),
                        "object": match.group(3).strip()}
            else:
                print(f"Warning: Could not parse triple from response: {response_text}")
                return None
        else:
            print(f"Error: Unsupported format: {expected_format}")
            return None
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"JSONDecodeError: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage:
llm_response = '{"subject": "Albert Einstein", "predicate": "bornIn", "object": "Ulm"}'
parsed_data = parse_llm_response(llm_response)

if parsed_data:
    print("Parsed data:", parsed_data)
else:
    print("Failed to parse LLM response.")

llm_response_triple = "Subject: Marie Curie, Predicate: discovered, Object: Polonium"
parsed_triple = parse_llm_response(llm_response_triple, "triple")

if parsed_triple:
    print("Parsed triple:", parsed_triple)
else:
    print("Failed to parse LLM response as triple.")
```

### III. RDF Triple Extraction Techniques

Once you have parsed the LLM's response, the next step is to extract RDF triples. Here are some techniques:

#### A. Rule-Based Extraction

*   **Pattern Matching:**  Define a set of rules that match specific patterns in the parsed data and extract the corresponding RDF triples.  This approach is suitable when the LLM's output follows a predictable structure.
*   **Keyword Extraction:**  Identify keywords in the parsed data that represent entities and relationships.  Use these keywords to construct RDF triples.
*   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**  Use NER techniques to identify named entities in the parsed data.  These entities can be used as subjects and objects in RDF triples.  Libraries like SpaCy and NLTK provide NER capabilities.
*   **Relationship Extraction:**  Use relationship extraction techniques to identify relationships between entities in the parsed data.  These relationships can be used as predicates in RDF triples.  Tools like Stanford CoreNLP and OpenIE can be used for relationship extraction.

#### B. Machine Learning-Based Extraction

*   **Sequence-to-Sequence Models:**  Train a sequence-to-sequence model to map the parsed data to a sequence of RDF triples.  This approach is suitable when the LLM's output is complex and doesn't follow a predictable structure.
*   **Transformer Models:**  Use transformer models like BERT or RoBERTa to extract RDF triples from the parsed data.  These models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as NER and relationship extraction.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:**  Use reinforcement learning to train an agent to extract RDF triples from the parsed data.  The agent learns to select the best actions (e.g., identifying entities and relationships) to maximize a reward function (e.g., the number of correctly extracted triples).

#### C. Hybrid Approaches

*   **Combining Rule-Based and ML-Based Techniques:**  Combine rule-based and ML-based techniques to improve the accuracy and robustness of the RDF triple extraction process.  For example, you can use rule-based techniques to extract triples from simple sentences and ML-based techniques to extract triples from complex sentences.
*   **Active Learning:**  Use active learning to iteratively improve the performance of the RDF triple extraction model.  The model selects the most informative examples from the LLM's output and asks a human to label them.  The model then uses these labeled examples to update its parameters.

#### D. Example Implementation (Python with SpaCy)

```python
import spacy

# Load the SpaCy model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_triples(text):
    """
    Extracts RDF triples from a text using SpaCy.

    Args:
        text (str): The text to extract triples from.

    Returns:
        list: A list of RDF triples, where each triple is a tuple of (subject, predicate, object).
    """
    doc = nlp(text)
    triples = []

    for token in doc:
        # Find the subject
        if token.dep_ == "nsubj":
            subject = token.text
            # Find the object
            for child in token.head.children:
                if child.dep_ == "dobj":
                    object = child.text
                    # The predicate is the verb
                    predicate = token.head.lemma_
                    triples.append((subject, predicate, object))

    return triples

# Example usage:
text = "Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity."
triples = extract_triples(text)
print(triples) # Output: [('Einstein', 'develop', 'theory')]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **SpaCy:** This example uses SpaCy for natural language processing.  It identifies the subject, predicate (verb), and object of a sentence.
2.  **Dependency Parsing:** SpaCy's dependency parsing is used to understand the grammatical structure of the sentence.  `nsubj` identifies the nominal subject, `dobj` the direct object, and the head of the subject token is usually the verb (predicate).
3.  **Triple Formation:** The extracted subject, predicate, and object are combined into a tuple representing an RDF triple.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **SpaCy Model:** The `en_core_web_sm` model is a small model. For better accuracy, consider using a larger model like `en_core_web_lg`.
*   **Complex Sentences:** This example is simplified and might not work well for complex sentences with multiple clauses or ambiguous relationships.  More sophisticated techniques may be needed for such cases.
*   **Ontology Alignment:** The extracted predicates and objects might need to be aligned with your Habitus33 ontology.  This might involve mapping the extracted terms to the corresponding terms in the ontology.

### IV. Writing Triples to Apache Jena Fuseki

Once you have extracted the RDF triples, you need to write them to your Apache Jena Fuseki graph database. Here's how:

#### A. Fuseki Connection

*   **SPARQL Endpoint:**  Identify the SPARQL endpoint of your Fuseki server.  This is the URL that you will use to send SPARQL queries to the server.  Typically, it's something like `http://localhost:3030/your_dataset/update`.
*   **Authentication:**  If your Fuseki server requires authentication, you will need to provide the appropriate credentials (username and password) when connecting to the server.
*   **SPARQL Update:**  Use the SPARQL Update language to add the RDF triples to the graph.  The `INSERT DATA` command is used to add new triples.

#### B. SPARQL Update Query Construction

*   **Triple Formatting:**  Format the RDF triples as SPARQL triples.  Each triple should be enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) and separated by spaces.  The subject, predicate, and object should be represented as URIs or literals.
*   **Namespace Prefixes:**  Define namespace prefixes for the URIs used in the triples.  This makes the SPARQL query more readable and concise.
*   **Batch Updates:**  To improve performance, consider batching multiple RDF triples into a single SPARQL Update query.  This reduces the number of requests sent to the Fuseki server.

#### C. Example Implementation (Python with SPARQLWrapper)

```python
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON

def update_fuseki(triples, fuseki_url="http://localhost:3030/your_dataset/update"):
    """
    Writes RDF triples to Apache Jena Fuseki using SPARQL Update.

    Args:
        triples (list): A list of RDF triples, where each triple is a tuple of (subject, predicate, object).
        fuseki_url (str): The URL of the Fuseki SPARQL update endpoint.
    """
    sparql = SPARQLWrapper(fuseki_url)
    sparql.setMethod("POST")  # Use POST for updates

    for subject, predicate, object in triples:
        # Construct the SPARQL update query
        update_query = f"""
            PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
            INSERT DATA {{
                ex:{subject} ex:{predicate} ex:{object} .
            }}
        """
        sparql.setQuery(update_query)
        try:
            sparql.query()
            print(f"Successfully added triple: ({subject}, {predicate}, {object})")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error adding triple ({subject}, {predicate}, {object}): {e}")

# Example usage:
triples = [
    ("Einstein", "bornIn", "Ulm"),
    ("MarieCurie", "discovered", "Polonium")
]
update_fuseki(triples)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **SPARQLWrapper:** This example uses the `SPARQLWrapper` library to interact with the Fuseki SPARQL endpoint.
2.  **SPARQL Update Query:** The `INSERT DATA` command is used to add the RDF triples to the graph.  The triples are formatted as SPARQL triples, with the subject, predicate, and object enclosed in angle brackets.
3.  **Namespace Prefix:** The `ex:` prefix is defined for the `http://example.org/` namespace.  You should replace this with your own namespace.  Consider using the Habitus33 ontology namespace.
4.  **Error Handling:** The `try-except` block catches any errors that occur during the update process.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Fuseki Configuration:**  Make sure your Fuseki server is running and accessible.  Also, make sure the dataset you are trying to update exists.
*   **Permissions:**  Ensure that the user you are using to connect to Fuseki has the necessary permissions to update the graph.
*   **Data Validation:**  Before writing the triples to Fuseki, validate the data to ensure it is consistent with your ontology.
*   **URI Encoding:**  Make sure that the URIs used in the triples are properly encoded.  Use the `urllib.parse.quote` function to encode any special characters in the URIs.
*   **Batching:**  For large numbers of triples, consider batching the updates to improve performance.  You can construct a single SPARQL Update query that inserts multiple triples at once.

#### D. Adapting to Habitus33 Ontology

The examples above use a generic `ex:` namespace.  You need to adapt them to use your Habitus33 ontology.  This involves:

1.  **Defining Prefixes:**  Define the appropriate prefixes for the Habitus33 ontology terms.  For example:

    ```sparql
    PREFIX h33: <http://habitus33.org/ontology#>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    ```

2.  **Using Ontology Terms:**  Use the Habitus33 ontology terms for the subjects, predicates, and objects in your triples.  For example:

    ```sparql
    INSERT DATA {
        h33:my_note h33:hasContent "This is the content of my note." .
    }
    ```

3.  **Data Type Considerations:**  Ensure that the data types of the literals you are using are consistent with the Habitus33 ontology.  For example, if a property is defined as an integer, make sure you are using an integer literal.

### V. Modern Approaches for Structured Data Extraction

Beyond the basic techniques, here are some modern approaches that can improve the accuracy and efficiency of structured data extraction:

#### A. Few-Shot Learning and Meta-Learning

*   **Few-Shot Learning:**  Train the LLM to extract structured data from a small number of examples.  This reduces the need for large labeled datasets.
*   **Meta-Learning:**  Train the LLM to learn how to learn.  This allows the LLM to quickly adapt to new tasks and domains with minimal training data.

#### B. Knowledge Graph Embedding

*   **Embedding Entities and Relationships:**  Embed the entities and relationships in your knowledge graph into a vector space.  This allows you to use machine learning techniques to identify similar entities and relationships.
*   **Using Embeddings for Triple Extraction:**  Use the embeddings to improve the accuracy of the RDF triple extraction process.  For example, you can use the embeddings to identify the most likely predicate for a given subject and object.

#### C. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

*   **Representing Data as Graphs:**  Represent the LLM's output as a graph, where the nodes represent entities and the edges represent relationships.
*   **Using GNNs for Triple Extraction:**  Use GNNs to learn the structure of the graph and extract RDF triples.  GNNs can capture complex relationships between entities and improve the accuracy of the triple extraction process.

#### D. Active Learning and Human-in-the-Loop

*   **Active Learning:**  Use active learning to iteratively improve the performance of the structured data extraction model.  The model selects the most informative examples from the LLM's output and asks a human to label them.  The model then uses these labeled examples to update its parameters.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:**  Incorporate a human-in-the-loop to review and correct the output of the structured data extraction model.  This is especially important for critical data.

### VI. Applying Research to Project Tasks

Here's how this research applies to your specific project tasks:

*   **Task 5 (Implement AI Response Parsing and Graph Update):**  This research provides the core techniques and best practices for parsing AI responses, extracting RDF triples, and writing them to Fuseki.  Focus on using JSON as the output format, SpaCy for triple extraction, and SPARQLWrapper for updating Fuseki.  Pay close attention to error handling and data validation.
*   **Task 4 (Implement Knowledge Gap and Hidden Link Detection Algorithms):**  The extracted RDF triples will be used to enrich the knowledge graph, which will then be used by the knowledge gap and hidden link detection algorithms.  The quality of the extracted triples directly impacts the accuracy of these algorithms.  Consider using knowledge graph embeddings to improve the performance of the hidden link detection algorithm.
*   **Task 6 (Create Integration Tests for /api/ai-link/execute):**  The integration tests should verify that the AI responses are correctly parsed, the RDF triples are correctly extracted, and the Fuseki graph is correctly updated.  Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including different output formats, complex sentences, and edge cases.
*   **Task 7 (Update Frontend to Display Knowledge Gaps and Hidden Links):**  The frontend should display the knowledge gaps and hidden links that are detected based on the enriched knowledge graph.  The accuracy of the displayed information depends on the quality of the extracted RDF triples.

### VII. Conclusion

Extracting structured data from LLM outputs and writing it to a knowledge graph is a complex but crucial task. By following the best practices and modern approaches outlined in this research, you can build a robust and accurate system that enhances your knowledge graph and enables automated reasoning and inference. Remember to adapt the techniques to your specific needs and to continuously monitor and improve the performance of your system.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **End-to-End Integration Testing:** Create end-to-end tests that simulate the entire learning loop. These tests should involve sending a query to the AI model, parsing the response, extracting triples, writing them to Fuseki, and then querying Fuseki to verify that the new triples have been successfully added and are semantically correct.
2.  **Triple Validation:** Implement a triple validation module that checks the validity of the extracted triples before they are written to Fuseki. This module should verify that the subjects, predicates, and objects are valid according to the Habitus33 ontology and that the triples do not violate any existing constraints.
3.  **Performance Testing:** Conduct performance tests to ensure that the ResponseHandler can handle a high volume of AI responses without significant performance degradation. Measure the time it takes to parse the responses, extract triples, and write them to Fuseki. Optimize the code as needed to improve performance.
4.  **Error Handling:** Test the error handling capabilities of the ResponseHandler. Simulate various error conditions (e.g., invalid AI response format, Fuseki connection errors) and verify that the ResponseHandler handles these errors gracefully and logs appropriate error messages.

### Phase 1: 출처 태깅 시스템
- `NewKnowledgeTriple` 인터페이스에 `sourceType: 'user_organic' | 'ai_assisted'` 추가
- `originalMemoId`와 `derivedFromUser` 필드로 추적 강화

### Phase 2: 신뢰도 알고리즘 개선  
- 사용자 순수 메모 연결: confidence 0.85-0.95
- AI 보조 연결: confidence 0.6-0.8
- 시간적 근접성, 메모 빈도 등 고려

### Phase 3: 자연스러운 연관성 발견
- 시간순 메모 분석으로 사용자 사고 진화 패턴 추출
- 숨겨진 연결 발견 시 `user_organic` 태깅

이제 사용자의 진짜 지식 공백과 메모 간 연결성을 정확히 찾아줄 수 있습니다! 🚀
