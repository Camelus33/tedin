# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Hover Animation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add hover animation to the memo cards in the 'more' view using Tailwind CSS.
# Details:
1.  Add the `hover:scale-110` class to the `TSNoteCard` component in the `MoreView`.
2.  Add the `transition-all duration-300 ease-out` class to the `TSNoteCard` component to ensure a smooth animation.
3.  Test the hover animation to ensure it scales the card up smoothly.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the memo cards scale up on hover in the `MoreView`.
2.  Check that the animation is smooth and lasts for 300ms.
3.  Ensure that the animation does not cause any layout shifts.
