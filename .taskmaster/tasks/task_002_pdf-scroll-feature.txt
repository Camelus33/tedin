# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement View Mode State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the view mode state management using React's useState hook, including the 'grid' and 'more' modes.
# Details:
1.  In the main dashboard component, declare a state variable `viewMode` using `useState('grid')`.
2.  Create a function `setViewMode` to update the `viewMode` state.
3.  Pass the `viewMode` state and `setViewMode` function to the relevant components.
4.  Implement logic to switch between 'grid' and 'more' modes based on user interaction (e.g., button click).
5.  Ensure the initial state is set to 'grid'.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the `viewMode` state is initialized correctly.
2.  Test the functionality to switch between 'grid' and 'more' modes.
3.  Ensure that the UI updates correctly when the `viewMode` changes.
4.  Check for any unexpected side effects when updating the state.
