# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Memo Card Loading and '더보기' Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the dashboard to initially load only the recent 3 memo cards in 'grid' mode and implement the '더보기' (more) button functionality to load all memo cards.
# Details:
1.  Fetch the initial 3 memo cards and store them in a state variable `recentMemos`.
2.  Display `recentMemos` in a 3-column grid layout when `viewMode` is 'grid'.
3.  Implement an API call to fetch all memo cards when the '더보기' button is clicked.
4.  Store all memo cards in a state variable `allMemos`.
5.  Update the UI to display `allMemos` in a 6-column grid layout when `viewMode` is 'more'.
6.  Implement error handling for the API call.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that only 3 memo cards are loaded initially in 'grid' mode.
2.  Test the '더보기' button to ensure all memo cards are loaded and displayed in 'more' mode.
3.  Check for correct grid layout in both 'grid' and 'more' modes.
4.  Test error handling for API call failures.
