# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Lazy Loading with IntersectionObserver
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement lazy loading using IntersectionObserver to optimize performance for large PDFs.
# Details:
1.  Use `IntersectionObserver` to detect when a page enters the viewport.
2.  Only render pages that are currently in or near the viewport.
3.  Implement a placeholder for pages that are not yet rendered.
4.  Optimize memory usage by unloading pages that are far from the viewport.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that only pages in or near the viewport are rendered.
2.  Check that placeholders are displayed for pages that are not yet rendered.
3.  Monitor memory usage to ensure it is optimized.
4.  Test scrolling performance with large PDFs (100+ pages).
