Implement stricter control over `useEffect` execution conditions.\n2.  Prevent `useEffect` from running on refresh.\n3.  Explore alternative approaches to `useEffect`.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n*   Utilize a `useIsMounted` hook.\n*   Employ `useMemo` for conditional execution.\n*   Prevent duplicate requests with `AbortController`.\n*   Skip the first rendering with `useRef`.\n</info added on 2025-07-05T03:21:42.937Z>",
