# Task ID: 7
# Title: Update Frontend to Display Knowledge Gaps and Hidden Links
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the frontend (AIConnectionHub & AILinkCommand) to display detected knowledge gaps and hidden links in the UI, including citation display, enhancing the user interface to present knowledge gap analysis and hidden link recommendations.
# Details:
1. **Integrate with AI Link API:** Modify the `AIConnectionHub` and `AILinkCommand` components to consume the output from the `/api/ai-link/execute` endpoint, which provides knowledge gap and hidden link data.
2. **Display Knowledge Gaps:** Implement UI elements to display detected knowledge gaps. This includes:
    *   A dedicated section in the UI to present the gaps.
    *   Clear and concise descriptions of each gap.
    *   Links to external resources (e.g., Wikipedia, DBpedia) to help users fill the gaps.
3. **Display Hidden Links:** Implement UI elements to display recommended hidden links. This includes:
    *   A dedicated section in the UI to present the links.
    *   Visual representations of the links between concepts in the knowledge graph.
    *   Explanations of the relationships between the linked concepts.
4. **Citation Display:** Implement a mechanism to display citations for the information presented, ensuring transparency and credibility. This includes:
    *   Displaying the source of the knowledge gap or hidden link information.
    *   Providing links to the original source documents.
5. **UI Design and Styling:** Ensure that the new UI elements are visually appealing and easy to use. Follow the existing design guidelines and maintain consistency with the rest of the application.
6. **User Interaction:** Implement interactive elements to allow users to explore the knowledge gaps and hidden links in more detail. This includes:
    *   Clickable links to navigate between concepts.
    *   Tooltips to provide additional information.
    *   Filtering and sorting options to customize the display.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Data Accuracy:** Verify that the knowledge gaps and hidden links displayed in the UI accurately reflect the data returned by the `/api/ai-link/execute` endpoint.
2. **UI Functionality:** Test all UI elements to ensure they function as expected. This includes:
    *   Clicking on links to external resources.
    *   Navigating between concepts.
    *   Using filtering and sorting options.
3. **Citation Verification:** Verify that the citations are displayed correctly and link to the appropriate source documents.
4. **Responsiveness:** Test the UI on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it is responsive and displays correctly.
5. **Usability Testing:** Conduct usability testing with a group of users to gather feedback on the design and functionality of the new UI elements. Use the feedback to make improvements and ensure that the UI is easy to use and understand.
