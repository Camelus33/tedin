			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the initialization process into smaller, manageable tasks. Consider subtasks for setting up Node.js, installing Express, configuring TypeScript, installing Mongoose, and setting up linting/formatting.",
			"reasoning": "Involves multiple steps and configuration settings. Requires familiarity with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and Mongoose. The configuration of TypeScript and linting tools adds complexity."

			"taskTitle": "Define InlineThread Schema and Update Note Model",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the schema definition and model update into separate subtasks. Consider subtasks for defining the InlineThread schema, updating the Note model, and verifying the schema definitions.",
			"reasoning": "Requires understanding of Mongoose schemas and model relationships. Updating the Note model to include the inlineThreads field is a straightforward but important step."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Create InlineThread API",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the API implementation into smaller parts. Consider subtasks for creating the route, extracting data from the request, creating the InlineThread instance, saving the thread to the database, updating the Note document, and handling errors.",
			"reasoning": "Involves creating a new API endpoint, interacting with the database, and handling authentication. Requires understanding of Express routing, Mongoose models, and JWT authentication."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the update API implementation. Consider subtasks for creating the route, extracting data from the request, finding the InlineThread, verifying user permissions, updating the thread, and handling errors.",
			"reasoning": "Similar complexity to creating a thread, but also involves verifying user permissions. Requires understanding of Express routing, Mongoose models, JWT authentication, and authorization."

			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the validation and sanitization process. Consider subtasks for setting up express-validator, implementing validation middleware, validating the content field, and sanitizing the input.",
			"reasoning": "Requires understanding of input validation and sanitization techniques. Using libraries like `express-validator` and `xss` adds complexity."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Performance Optimizations",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the performance optimization tasks. Consider subtasks for creating indexes, verifying connection pooling, monitoring API response times, and implementing caching mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Involves database indexing and connection pooling. Monitoring API response times and implementing caching mechanisms adds complexity."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Unit and Integration Tests",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the testing process into smaller, testable units. Consider subtasks for setting up the testing framework, writing unit tests for each route handler, writing integration tests, writing authentication tests, and ensuring adequate code coverage.",
			"reasoning": "Requires writing unit and integration tests for all API endpoints. Testing authentication and authorization adds complexity. Requires familiarity with testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha."
