			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for locating tab elements, applying Tailwind classes for mobile, handling active/inactive states, and testing on different mobile screen sizes.",
			"reasoning": "Involves conditional styling and handling different states, adding slightly more complexity than tasks 2 and 3."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure Overall Visual Consistency on Mobile",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into subtasks for reviewing the page layout, adjusting padding and margin, ensuring color harmony, and refining the visual hierarchy.",
			"reasoning": "This is a more holistic task requiring a good understanding of design principles and attention to detail. It depends on the completion of tasks 2, 3, and 4."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Test and Verify UI on Mobile Devices",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for responsive testing, functional testing (with a checklist), cross-browser testing, performance testing, documenting the testing process, and creating a bug report for any issues found.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing is crucial and involves multiple aspects. Requires a structured approach and thoroughness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Resolve CSS Priority Conflicts",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into subtasks for inspecting CSS, adjusting specificity, avoiding `!important`, and testing on different mobile screen sizes.",
			"reasoning": "Requires debugging and understanding CSS specificity rules. Can be time-consuming depending on the number of conflicts."
