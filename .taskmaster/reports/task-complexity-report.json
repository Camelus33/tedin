			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Performance Optimizations",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the performance optimization tasks. Consider subtasks for creating indexes, verifying connection pooling, monitoring API response times, and implementing caching mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Involves database indexing and connection pooling. Monitoring API response times and implementing caching mechanisms adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Unit and Integration Tests",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the testing process into smaller, testable units. Consider subtasks for setting up the testing framework, writing unit tests for each route handler, writing integration tests, writing authentication tests, and ensuring adequate code coverage.",
			"reasoning": "Requires writing unit and integration tests for all API endpoints. Testing authentication and authorization adds complexity. Requires familiarity with testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Analyze TSNoteCard.tsx for Inline Thread Data Handling",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the analysis of TSNoteCard.tsx into subtasks focusing on: 1) Identifying state and props related to inline threads, 2) Examining code for creating/updating/deleting threads, 3) Analyzing thread ID generation and management, and 4) Identifying potential ID mapping or data structure issues.",
			"reasoning": "Requires understanding of React component structure, state management, and optimistic updates. Debugging with React DevTools adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Verify Server Response Data Structure and Frontend State Synchronization",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the verification task into: 1) Inspecting the API endpoint and response data structure, 2) Comparing the response to the expected frontend structure and verifying the _id field, and 3) Implementing data validation using TypeScript interfaces.",
			"reasoning": "Involves API inspection, data structure comparison, and TypeScript usage. Requires knowledge of backend data format and frontend expectations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Logic to Replace Temporary IDs with Actual IDs After Optimistic Updates",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation into: 1) Generating temporary IDs for new threads, 2) Storing the mapping between temporary and actual IDs, 3) Updating the component's state with the actual ID after a successful operation, 4) Ensuring all references use the actual ID, and 5) Implementing state management for ID mapping (e.g., using Zustand or Jotai).",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to optimistic updates, ID mapping, and state management. Requires careful handling of asynchronous operations and data consistency."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance ID Validation and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the enhancement into: 1) Implementing a check for defined thread IDs before sending delete requests, 2) Logging an error and preventing the request if the ID is undefined, and 3) Displaying an error message to the user.",
			"reasoning": "Relatively straightforward validation and error handling. TypeScript usage simplifies the process."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Verify Thread Information is Displayed Correctly After Refresh",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the verification into: 1) Manually creating, updating, and deleting threads and refreshing the page, 2) Inspecting the API endpoint for data persistence, and 3) Implementing Cypress end-to-end tests to automate the process.",
			"reasoning": "Requires end-to-end testing and verification of data persistence. Cypress knowledge is needed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Verify Complete Resolution of CastError",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the verification into: 1) Running existing end-to-end tests, 2) Creating new end-to-end tests covering all scenarios, 3) Verifying the absence of CastError, and 4) Ensuring all thread operations function as expected.",
			"reasoning": "Requires comprehensive end-to-end testing and debugging. Ensuring complete resolution of the error can be challenging."
