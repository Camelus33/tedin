			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Prevent Unintended Changes to Memo Card Design",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into subtasks for verifying that `TSNoteCard` is not modified and verifying the memo card design remains unchanged.",
			"reasoning": "Simple task focused on preventing regressions. Primarily a verification step."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Prevent Damage to Existing Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into subtasks for creating a checklist, performing functional testing, documenting the testing process, and creating bug reports for any issues found.",
			"reasoning": "Requires a systematic approach to ensure existing functionality is not broken. Similar to a subset of task 6."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure Cross-Browser Compatibility",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into subtasks for testing on major browsers, using safe CSS properties, and documenting browser-specific issues.",
			"reasoning": "Requires testing on different browsers and awareness of potential compatibility issues."

		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Minimize Performance Impact",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into subtasks for minimizing new classes, performing performance testing, and documenting performance metrics.",
			"reasoning": "Requires awareness of performance best practices and the ability to measure performance impact."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Dependency Installation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into smaller, more manageable tasks. Consider subtasks for Node.js/npm verification, Tailwind CSS installation, Tailwind CSS configuration, react-pdf installation, and TSNoteCard verification.",
			"reasoning": "While the steps are well-defined, there are multiple dependencies and configurations that could present minor issues. Breaking it down will allow for easier debugging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement View Mode State Management",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the state management implementation into subtasks for state variable declaration, function creation for state updates, and integration with relevant components.",
			"reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward, but splitting it into subtasks will improve clarity and organization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Memo Card Loading and '더보기' Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the memo card loading and '더보기' functionality into subtasks for initial memo fetching, grid display implementation, API call implementation, full memo storage, and UI update for 'more' mode.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves API calls and UI updates, making it moderately complex. Subtasks will help manage the different aspects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement UI Components for Grid and More Views",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the UI component implementation into subtasks for GridView creation, MoreView creation, Tailwind CSS styling, and TSNoteCard integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating and styling UI components, requiring careful attention to detail. Subtasks will help organize the development process."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Hover Animation",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for adding the `hover:scale-110` and `transition-all` classes to the TSNoteCard component.",
			"reasoning": "This is a simple styling task with minimal complexity. Breaking it down into two subtasks will ensure each aspect is addressed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Continuous Vertical Scrolling in PDF Viewer",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the continuous vertical scrolling implementation into subtasks for page rendering modification, navigation button removal, container style adjustment, and props interface maintenance.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires modifying an existing component and ensuring compatibility, making it moderately complex. Subtasks will help manage the different aspects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Lazy Loading with IntersectionObserver",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the lazy loading implementation into subtasks for IntersectionObserver setup, conditional page rendering, placeholder implementation, memory usage optimization, and performance testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves advanced techniques like IntersectionObserver and memory optimization, making it highly complex. Subtasks are crucial for managing the different aspects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Scroll-Based Page Tracking and Control Bar Synchronization",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the scroll-based page tracking and control bar synchronization into subtasks for IntersectionObserver-based tracking, control bar update implementation, highlight/text selection compatibility, and zoom/rotation compatibility.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating scroll position with UI elements and ensuring compatibility with existing features, making it complex. Subtasks will help manage the different aspects."
